I used to use [swiftype](https://swiftype.com/) as my site search engine, however, it does not provide nay free plan now, what's more, the [price](https://swiftype.com/pricing) is too high for my personal blog (Seems my previous free plan is not auto cancelled by swiftype). However, it is time to find an alternative now. And it is [Tipue search](http://www.tipue.com/search/).

## Research
I go through [hexo plugin](https://hexo.io/plugins/) page very carefully, and find there are 2 related plugins may be helpful for me:
1. [hexo-generator-search](https://github.com/PaicHyperionDev/hexo-generator-search): this is XML based
2. [hexo-generator-json-content](https://github.com/alexbruno/hexo-generator-json-content): this is JSON based

I tried to use the latter one(I like JSON more than XML), but find I cannot use it well, as I am not a JS expert. Also, I googled some Open-Source search engine tools, and I finally find [TIPUE SEARCH](http://www.tipue.com/search/)

## Problem
Now I have the Open-Source search engine tool and JSON generator. But the JSON generated by `hexo-generator-json-content` does not fit `Tipue Search`. 
Comes 2 solutions now:
1. customize `hexo-generator-json-content`
2. customize `Tipue Search`

This is not a difficult decision, and I prefer the first one.

So I create this repo: [Hexo-Tipue-Search-Json](https://github.com/zhouhao/Hexo-Tipue-Search-Json)

## How to install it
