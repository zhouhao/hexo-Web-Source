I have many servers, which run Java Web applications. For development, I like Jetty, but for production, I prefer Tomcat7 now.
### In ubuntu, you need root permission to use ports under `1024`.

When you Google this topic, you will find a lot of solutions around the Internet, but many of them are not so useful, even some try to trap you.

So I just record what I do for this issue in **Ubuntu**:

1. Open `/var/lib/tomcat7/conf/server.xml` or `/etc/tomcat7/server.xml`(they are the same), modify code as below
```xml
<!-- more code here -->

  <Connector port="80" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
             connectionTimeout="20000"
             URIEncoding="UTF-8"
             redirectPort="8443" />

<!-- more code here -->
```

2. Open `/etc/default/tomcat`:
```bash
# If you run Tomcat on port numbers that are all higher than 1023, then you
# do not need authbind.  It is used for binding Tomcat to lower port numbers.
# NOTE: authbind works only with IPv4.  Do not enable it when using IPv6.
# (yes/no, default: no)
AUTHBIND=yes
```

3. In very rare case, you need to change `TOMCAT7_USER=tomcat7` to `TOMCAT7_USER=root`. [This is not recommended]
