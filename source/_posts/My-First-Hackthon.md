Maybe in the June, Wen, the CEO of Smarking Inc gave a link to apply YC Hackthon. Then, in a morning, when I was waiting the subway, I got the email that my application was accepted. Not so superised, as it just means I still did the same thing(coding) in a different place.
Thanks for the CMU competition, Wen can afford the flight fee for us to CA. (31st July ~ 4 August)

We came to CA two days before the hackthon. But as the [rule](http://ychacks.challengepost.com/rules) below, we cannot coding until 2 August. So I prepared the document the whole day in Mcdonalds, and defined what we would do in the hackthon.(I'd say that the free wifi in Mcdonalds is so bad, and I have to buy the daily pass of Xinfinity.)
![Rule](https://dn-myblog.qbox.me/img/ychackthon/rule.png "Rule")

After working the whole night without sleep, finally, we made a demo which can be played:
### What have we done?
1. We build multiple and useful Server Side APIs to the public
2. Web Apps and mobile apps(android&iOS)

**This is the shit we did:http://challengepost.com/software/timesaverforfoodtruck**
![The shit we have done](https://dn-myblog.qbox.me/img/ychackthon/screenshot.png "The shit we have done")
### Note:
1. We have watch a film the first night to CA. :-)
2. I almost did every technic thing, from system architect, API design, server side programming, android/iOS app building to document writing. Really tough work~~~
3. We are so naive. <b style="color:red">As my experience, the winners' projects are impossible be done during 24 hours. But the holders seem not care this at all<b>.
4. All the submissions in YC hackthon: http://ychacks.challengepost.com/submissions
