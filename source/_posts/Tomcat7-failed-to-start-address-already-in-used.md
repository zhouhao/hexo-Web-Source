Sometime, when I failed to restart my tomcat7 server, and in the log, it returns error: `**address already in use!**`
<!-- more -->

In this case, you can do some check as below:

1. Check whether the port for `tomcat7` is used by other applications, such as `apache2`, nginx... The port number may be `80`, `8080`, which depends on your configuration, but default is `8080`.

2. In some rare cases, I am sure the ports above is not occupied by other application. So, what is happening???

### Please check whether the `shut down port 8005` is occupied or not, and this may happen if tomcat7 crashes!

```bash
# find the pid of 8005
fuser 8005/tcp

# kill the pid
kill -9 ${number_of_pid}
```

### Now, you can restart your tomcat 7!
