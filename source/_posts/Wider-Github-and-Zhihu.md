The main div for GitHub and Zhihu is too narrow, which makes my high-resolution screen not that useful. In this case, I update some exiting stylish script to improve.
<!-- more --> 

You can download the stylish [here](/file/stylus-2019-02-02.json), and import it to [stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne).

**BTW**: I have some some hard-coded style for my 2560 x 1440(or similar) screen. I also fix the style for github home page.

Another improve for github - ***add personal&star links in head menu***
 ![add Personal Link into Headder](/img/2019-01-28-23.png "add Personal Link into Headder")
 This is a [tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) script, which can be download [here](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/368459-github-com-extra-header-links-modified). 
 (This is also a modified version from existing one, thanks for the good work from open source contributors)
