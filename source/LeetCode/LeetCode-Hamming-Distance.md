The [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

### Note:
0 ≤ `x, y` < 2<sup>31</sup>.

### Example:

```
Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

```java
public class Solution {
    public int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int z = x ^ y;
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            int mask = 1 << i;
            if ((mask & z) > 0) {
                result++;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
